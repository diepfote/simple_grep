Simple grep
^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple grep is a minimal implementation of grep. It is entirely written in Python.
==================================================================================

Most notable alteration: No file or directory specified implies searching in current directory.
Missing features: stdin support for Windows.

Simple grep is tested on:
* CPython 2.7 and 3.6.

(Some tests might fail on Windows)
